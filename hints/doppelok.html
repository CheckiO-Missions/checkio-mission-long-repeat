        You need to calculate how many elements in a row are repeated one after the other and find the maximum value of repetitions.
        I suggest that you gradually remove identical elements from left to right, and calculate how much the row has shortened.
        This difference will be equal to the number of deleted objects.
        You can compile the received values into a list, and then simply output the maximum value.

        Let's start by figuring out what should be done in the while loop.
        In this cycle, you should cut off the first element/elements (if they are repeated several times in a row).
        <pre class="brush: python">
while line:  # The loop will run until the string is empty
    line = line.lstrip(line[0])

# output
''
        </pre>

        In order for us to determine how much our line has shortened, we need to add a variable that will remember
        the length of the line before it was shortened.
        <pre class="brush: python">
lenline = len(line)  # Save the length of the given line
while line:
    line = line.lstrip(line[0])
    lenline = len(line)  # We update the length of the given line
        </pre>

    <div class="answer">
         Okay, you need to add another variable that will contain a list of values of the difference of shortened lines.
         But each time add a new value to this list.
        <pre class="brush: python">
result = []  # The list where our result will be saved
lenline = len(line)
while line:
    line = line.lstrip(line[0])
    result.append(lenline - len(line))  # We add the difference between the lengths to the list
    lenline = len(line)

# output
[0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1]

        You have a few things left. Wrap this in a function expression and return the maximum value among all result
        values, that will be the answer. It is also desirable to protect our code from an empty string ;-).
        Therefore, we will use the "default" argument in the max() function, if the function cannot calculate the
        maximum value, it will return "0".
        <pre class="brush: python">
def long_repeat(line: str) -> int:
    result = []
    lenline = len(line)
    while line:
        line = line.lstrip(line[0])
        result.append(lenline - len(line))
        lenline = len(line)
    return max(result, default=0)  # we return the maximum value
        </pre>

        Okay, okay! That's the spirit!=)
        This solution will be difficult to understand. The
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/re.html'>"re"</a> module is used here. With the help of the expression "re.findall(r'((.)\2*)"
        we can walk through the string and get in response
        [('s', 's'), ('d', 'd'), ('s', 's'), ('ffff', 'f'), ('s', 's'), ('e', 'e')].
        From such a list of ("element repetition", "element") we can easily find the most repeated element and its number.
        <pre class="brush: python">
import re


def long_repeat(line: str) -> int:
    return max(len(i[0]) for i in re.findall(r'((.)\2*)', line)) if line else 0
        </pre>
